use crate::Style;

/// Enum representing text attributes, largely for text formatting.
///
/// Text attributes are typically applied to a [`Style`], [`Color`], or
/// [`Painted`] struct via the corresponding chainable builder methods such as
/// [`bold()`] or [`italic()`]. The returned value will apply the attribute(s)
/// when rendered or printed.
///
/// Attributes are idempotent, so applying an attribute more than once has no
/// more affect than applying it once.
///
/// # Terminal Support
///
/// Whether an applied attribute actually has an effect on how text is rendered
/// in a terminal depends on the terminal's support for the attribute as well as
/// the terminal's configuration. Common attributes, such as `bold`, `dim`,
/// `italic`, `underline`, and `strike` typically have good support and are
/// largely reliable. Less commonly supported attributes like `conceal` and
/// `invert` will _usually_ be supported by "modern" terminals. Rarely supprted
/// attributes, like  `blink` and `rapid blink` will usually have no effect when
/// applied.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use yansi::{Style, Color::Red};
///
/// /// A style with red foreground and every "common" attribute applied.
/// static MAD: Style = Red.bold().dim().italic().underline().strike();
/// ```
///
/// [`Style`]: crate::Style
/// [`Painted`]: crate::Painted
/// [`Color`]: crate::Painted
/// [`bold()`]: crate::Style::bold()
/// [`italic()`]: crate::Style::italic()
